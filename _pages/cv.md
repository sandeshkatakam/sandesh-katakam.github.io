## Education
<hr>

* __M.S.__ in Mathematics, IISER Berhampur, 2025(expected)
  * Thesis: Yet to be declared.
* __B.S.__ in Mathematics, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research(IISER) Berhampur
  * Minor : Physics


## Research Experience
<hr>

* **Research Intern, IISER Berhampur (March 2022 - Present):**
  > I am currently a research intern in Dr.Vivek Tiwari's NeuroImaging:
Brain Research group. I am working on generating an efficient masking
model for segmenting brain tumors and classifying the tumor into
ET(Enhancing tumor), WT(Whole Tumor), and TC(Tumor Core).

* **Summer research Intern, IIT Hyderabad (May 2022 - Present):**
  > I worked at IIT Hyderabad CS and A.I. Department under Prof. Srijith
P.K. I worked on NeuralODEs for Irregularly sample Time-series data.
We used variation of Heat equation as our Differential Equation to
model the parameters of the Neural Network.[GitHub Link](https://sandeshkatakam.github.io/My-Machine_learning-Blog/deep%20learning/neuralnetworks/jax_library/neuralodes/resnets/2022/05/31/NeuralODEs-Tutorial.html)

* **Brain Tumor Segmentation Project (April 2022):**
  I worked on Brain Tumor segmentation using U-Net and generating an
effective mask for brain tumors. We reproduced the results from the
paper “3D MRI BrainTumor Segmentation using Autoencoder
regularization” by NVIDIA Labs. We are working on implementing
NeuralODE model for Brain Tumor segmentation.

* **Open Source Projects:**
  * [My Machine learning Library Project](https://github.com/sandeshkatakam/My-ML-Library):
    > Implemented basic Machine Learning Algorithms in
Python from scratch using only Numpy and Pandas.
Algorithms Implemented -Decision Tree, KNN,
K-Means, Neural Network, Logistic Regression, Linear
Regression.
