2020-2025 (expected)
:   **Master of Science (MS) Physics**
    *Thesis title: Yet to be declared*

2020-2025(expected)
:   **Bachelor of Science (BS) Physics**
      *Minor: Mathematics*

Experience
----------

**Undergraduate Student Researcher**

I have done multiple self assigned reading project on various topics. 


Technical Experience
--------------------

Data Analysis in Python Project:
:   GitHub Gist of the project: [Axis Bank Stock Data Analysis Project](https://gist.github.com/sandeshkatakam/891945502c6e0914ebb0436f0029971b)  


Open Source:
:   I am currently working on developing SciML package in Julia. The sample repo is hosted on GitHub: [MyPackage1](https://github.com/sandeshkatakam/MyPackage1)  

Programming Languages: 
:   **Python:** 
    * Data Analysis Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn etc.
    *Machine learning Libraries: Tensorflow, Pytorch, Fastai, Keras, Scikit-learn.
    *

:   **MATLAB:** I have used Matlab for Machine learning course. I have done all the assignments in MATLAB. As a part of the stanford ML course, I have done a project: 
    [Hand-Written Digit classifier using Neural Netowrks on MNIST data set](https://github.com/sandeshkatakam/coursera-Machine-Learning-Assignments/tree/main/ex4-Handwritten_digit_classifier)

:   **Julia:** I am currently working with Julia and trying to contribute to the package ecosystem of Julia. I am using Julia to work on Scientific Machine Learning and Physics-Informed Neural Networks. I feel Julia is the best in Scientifc Computing.

:   **C++:**  I am comfortable with programming in C++. I learned Data Structres and Algorithms in C++. I used C++ for Competitive Programming.

Software Utilities and Other tools:
:   **Version Control:** I am well versed with using git for version control operations. I have used git in all my projects to work back and forth with repos in local machine and Remote repos.

:   **DevOps Tools:** I used CI/CD tools while developing my Julia Package for automating the testing using GitHub actions and continously deploying after proper testing.
