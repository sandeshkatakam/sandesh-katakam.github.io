>  *"If you think you have reached the peak of a mountain, then find a bigger mountain"* 

I am an undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics. I am interested in Neural Differential Equations, Scientific Machine learning and Information Theory. I am currently working on the conjoining of Dynamical systems and Deep Learning. I am proficient in Julia, Python, C/C++, MATLAB and Bash(shell-scripting). I like working on projects at the interface of deep learning and differential equations. I am interested in developing Robust Machine Learning models and improving existing models towards better interpretability.

Education:
------- 

* __M.S.__ in Mathematics, IISER Berhampur, 2025(expected)
  * Thesis: Yet to be declared.
* __B.S.__ in Mathematics, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Berhampur, INDIA

Research interests:
------  
>* Neural Differential Equations and Scientific Machine Learning Methods
>* Bayesian Deep Learning Methods and Probabilistic Machine Learning
>* Deep Reinforcement learning and Self-Supervised Reinforcement Learning
>* Deep Generative Models: GANs, VAEs, Normalizing Flows, Autoregressive Models(Transformers)
>* Unsupervised and Self-Supervised Learning Models
>* Automated Machine Learning(AutoML), Continual Learning and Meta-learning
>* Foundation Models for Decision Making Problems
