### Hey, there! So, you reached my website!!
>  *"Problems worthy of attack prove their worth by fighting back   -- Paul Erdos"*

I am an undergraduate mathematics major at IISER Berhampur, with a strong interest in the field of machine learning research. My research interests primarily revolve around neural differential equations, model-based reinforcement learning and deep generative models.
Having gained previous experience in deep learning for medical imaging and foundation models, I possess a solid foundation necessary for research in this domain. I am proficient with various deep learning frameworks such as JAX, PyTorch and Tensorflow and have strong programming knowledge across Python, Julia and C++.

I am on the lookout for captivating research opportunities that lie at the dynamic intersection of Neural Differential Equations (NeuralDEs) and Model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). What truly ignites my enthusiasm is the prospect of engaging in projects that drive the development of cutting-edge, sample  efficient model-based RL techniques for practical, real-world applications. Through the powerful combination of generative modeling and neural DEs, I am eager to dive deeper and implement hybrid techniques for constructing world models for model-based RL environments and work towards developing more robust and explainable reinforcement learning. I am also interested in working on meta-learning and other continual approaches for model-based RL.
