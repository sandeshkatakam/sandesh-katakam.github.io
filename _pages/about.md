## Hey, there! So, you reached my website!!

>  *"Problems worthy of attack prove their worth by fighting back   -- Paul Erdos"*

I am an undergraduate mathematics major(with a CS Minor) at IISER Berhampur, with a strong interest in the field of machine learning research. My research interests primarily revolve around neural differential equations, model-based reinforcement learning, and deep generative models. Apart from my usual research interests, I have a strong interest in Machine Learning Systems. I have a keen interest in developing software for machine learning research. 

I am on the lookout for captivating research opportunities that lie at the dynamic intersection of Neural Differential Equations (NeuralDEs) and Model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). What truly ignites my enthusiasm is the prospect of engaging in projects that drive the development of cutting-edge, sample-efficient model-based RL techniques for practical, real-world applications. Through the powerful combination of generative modeling and neural DEs, I am eager to dive deeper and implement hybrid techniques for constructing world models for model-based RL environments and work towards developing more robust and explainable reinforcement learning.
