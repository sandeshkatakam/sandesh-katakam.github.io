I am an Undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics with a minor in Physics. My primary research interests are Quantum Computing/Quantum Information Theory and Scientific Machine learning. I am also interested in working in the domains of Quantum Machine Learning, Physics-Informed Neural Networks, Neural ODEs and other interdisciplinary domains. I am equipped with strong programming skills working with Python, C/C++, Julia and MATLAB . I work on machine learning and scienc I have done various projects using time-series datasets and analyzing the data using standard Data science and ML Techniques. I am currently working on Scientific Machine learning projects using Julia Programming language.
