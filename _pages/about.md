I am an Undergraduate Student Majoring in Mathematics with a Minor in Computer Science at [IISER Berhampur](https://www.iiserbpr.ac.in/).  I am currently doing my Master's Thesis Research work at IIT Hyderabad with [Dr.Srijith P.K.](https://sites.google.com/site/pksrijith/home) at the intersection of Reinforcement Learning and Deep Generative Models.

**Research,** I am interested in working on **Zero-shot Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning** models that can adapt to downstream tasks with the prospect of developing **Foundation Models for Decision Making Systems**.

**Outside Research,** Alongside my primary research work, I have a particular interest in **Machine Learning Systems(MLSys)** with a focus on developing efficient deep learning models for the Edge Devices and builing better compute infrastructure for ML Model Training. **I love Open Source** and I spend time actively contributing to open source projects of my own and others (some of them are mentioned on the software page)

I am on the lookout for possible research opportunities in the field of Deep Reinforcement learning. Feel free to connect with me to discuss **potential collaborations**, **research opportunities** and **Cool Open Source Project Ideas**.
