I am undergraduate student currently working towards my basic sciences degree. I am majoring in physics with a minor in mathematics. I am interested pursuing a career in research. As my undergraduate research work, I am planning to work on Quantum Information Theory and Quantum Computing. I am interested more towards interdisciplinary research. My interests outside my primary research domain are Scientific Machine learning and Physics Infomed Neural Networks.  

I wanted to pursue research in quantum error correcting codes and the correlation between the conecept of quantum information with quantum gravity. I am currently doing a self assigned literature survery/reading project on quantum computing/Information Theory to understand the existing literature and recognise potential problem that I can work on. 

I started working on scientific Machine learing after I learned Julia programming language. I like working with Julia programming language on ML projects. The Julia Language is really fast compared to other high level programming languages. One of my most favourite features are its rich unicode set allows us to write generic functions with ready to use math objects,  multiple dispatch functionality, the ability to look under the hood processes of our code. One of the motivating factors for me to work on SciML and PINNs(Physics Informed Neural Networks) is the potential of the concepts that are being developed that can solve some major problems in basic sciences. SciML is a mixture of Neural Networks and Differential Equations. Since all the known physical processes can be governed by differential equations. we can put a constraint on the possible learning paramters of the Neural Networks analyzing the physical limitations of the problem. SciML can accelereate the simulation of the complex dynamic systems faster using Neural Networks.

I will continue to update the reserach section of this webpage with upcoming research advancements in the following domains.
