## Neural Differential Equations

Neural Differential Equations are new class of deep learning models that show promising results for tasks like generative modelling, time-series modelling etc. Neural differential equations have applications to both deep learning and traditional mathematical modelling. They offer memory efficiency, the ability to handle irregular data, strong priors on model space, high capacity function approximation, and draw on a deep well of theory on both sides. 

## Scientific Machine learning and PINNs

Physics Informed Neural Networks are new clas


## Scientific Computing  

I am currently interested in learning and implementing scientific computing methods in my projects.





## Kernel Theory and Information Theory



I am an undergraduate student majoring in Math with a minor in Physics. I am interested in Scientific Machine learning. I am currently working on NeuralODEs and their application to sequence modeling(like LSTMs and Time-series forecasting). I work with black-box differential equation solvers for calculating the gradients without using backpropagation thereby eliminating the memory costs of large models. I am also interested in Information Theory and its applications to learning systems(like Deep neural nets). I wanted to work in the intersection of Stochastic Differential equations and Deep neural nets in the future. I am also interested to work on other statistical concepts like Optimal Transport etc. I am a self-taught programmer with a passion for programming systems that scale-up. The programming languages I currently work with are Python, Julia, C++, and some MATLAB. I am more into the mathematics of machine learning rather than production-based ML models. I wish to understand the concept of interpretability and causal inference for machine learning models(which means I am more interested in what the model is learning from data rather than how good it is learning from the given data).  


One of the motivating factors for me to work on SciML and PINNs(Physics Informed Neural Networks) is the potential of the concepts that are being developed that can solve some major problems in basic sciences. SciML is a mixture of Neural Networks and Differential Equations. Since all the known physical processes can be governed by differential equations. we can put a constraint on the possible learning paramters of the Neural Networks analyzing the physical limitations of the problem. SciML can accelereate the simulation of the complex dynamic systems faster using Neural Networks.  

One of my other interests is Deep learning for medical research (or biological sciences in general). I am currently working towards using Deep learning techniques from computer vision and segmentation models(like U-Nets) for analyzing the Brain tumor MRIs of Glioblastoma patients.  
 

I will continue to update the reserach section of this webpage with upcoming research advancements in the following domains.
