This notebook demonstrates, how to  build a logistic regression classifier to recognize  cats. This notebook will step you through how to do this with a Neural Network mindset, and will also hone your intuitions about deep learning. This notebook is a modified version of the assignment I had done for the course: [Neural Netoworks and Deep learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?).
