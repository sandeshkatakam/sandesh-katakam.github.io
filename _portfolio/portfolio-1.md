The project is based on the dataset I obtained from kaggle. The Analysis I am performing is on the 'AXISBANK' stock market data from 2019-2021.AXISBANK is one of the stocks listed in NIFTY50 index. The NIFTY 50 is a benchmark Indian stock market index that represents the weighted average of 50 of the largest Indian companies listed on the National Stock Exchange. It is one of the two main stock indices used in India, the other being the BSE SENSEX. The Analysis is performed on the stock quote data of "AXIS BANK" from the dataset of NIFTY50 Stock Market data obtained from kaggle repo.
