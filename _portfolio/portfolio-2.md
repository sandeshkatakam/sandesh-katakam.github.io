title: "NormVAE Model on NeuroImaging data"
excerpt: "Implementation of the paper: “NormVAE: Normative modeling on NeuroImaging data using Variational Autoencoders”. I trained the model with our own custom dataset of MCI/AD patient data from ADNI. Generated the deviation maps for studying how much the diseased brain region volumes deviate from that of Healthy Controls..  <br/><img src='/images/normvae.png'>"
